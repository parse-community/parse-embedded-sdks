 * \page asfdoc_sam0_sercom_i2c_master_callback_use_case Quick Start Guide for SERCOM I2C Master - Callback
 *
 * In this use case, the I<SUP>2</SUP>C will used and set up as follows:
 *  - Master mode
 *  - 100kHz operation speed
 *  - Not operational in standby
 *  - 65535 unknown bus state timeout value
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam0_sercom_i2c_master_callback_use_case_prereq Prerequisites
 * The device must be connected to an I<SUP>2</SUP>C slave.
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam0_sercom_i2c_master_callback_use_case_setup Setup
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_sercom_i2c_master_callback_use_case_setup_code Code
 * The following must be added to the user application:
 *
 * A sample buffer to write from, a reversed buffer to write from and length of
 * buffers.
 * \snippet qs_i2c_master_callback.c packet_data
 *
 * Address of slave:
 * \snippet qs_i2c_master_callback.c address
 *
 * Globally accessible module structure:
 * \snippet qs_i2c_master_callback.c dev_inst
 *
 * Globally accessible packet:
 * \snippet qs_i2c_master_callback.c packet_glob
 *
 * Function for setting up module:
 * \snippet qs_i2c_master_callback.c initialize_i2c
 *
 * Callback function for write complete:
 * \snippet qs_i2c_master_callback.c callback_func
 *
 * Function for setting up the callback functionality of the driver:
 * \snippet qs_i2c_master_callback.c setup_callback
 *
 * Add to user application main():
 * \snippet qs_i2c_master_callback.c run_initialize_i2c
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_sercom_i2c_master_callback_use_case_setup_workflow Workflow
 * -# Configure and enable module.
 *    \snippet qs_i2c_master_callback.c config
 *  -# Create and initialize configuration structure.
 *     \snippet qs_i2c_master_callback.c init_conf
 *  -# Change settings in the configuration.
 *     \snippet qs_i2c_master_callback.c conf_change
 *  -# Initialize the module with the set configurations.
 *     \snippet qs_i2c_master_callback.c init_module
 *  -# Enable the module.

 *    \snippet qs_i2c_master_callback.c packet
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam0_sercom_i2c_master_callback_use_case_implementation Implementation
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_sercom_i2c_master_callback_use_case_code Code
 * Add to user application main:
 * \snippet qs_i2c_master_callback.c while
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_sercom_i2c_master_callback_use_case_implementation_workflow Workflow
 * -# Write packet to slave.
 *    \snippet qs_i2c_master_callback.c write_packet

 *    \snippet qs_i2c_master_callback.c while
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam0_sercom_i2c_master_callback_use_case_callback Callback
 * Each time a packet is sent, the callback function will be called.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_sercom_i2c_master_callback_use_case_callback_workflow Workflow
 * - Write complete callback:
 *  -# Send every other packet in reversed order.
 *     \snippet qs_i2c_master_callback.c revert_order
 *  -# Write new packet to slave.
 *     \snippet qs_i2c_master_callback.c write_next
