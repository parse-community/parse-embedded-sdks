 * \page asfdoc_sam0_sercom_spi_dma_use_case Quick Start Guide for Using DMA with SERCOM SPI
 *
 * The supported board list:
 *    - SAMD21 Xplained Pro
 *    - SAMR21 Xplained Pro
 *
 * This quick start will transmit a buffer data from master to slave through DMA.
 * In this use case the SPI master will be configured with the following
 * settings on SAMD21 Xplained Pro:
 * - Master Mode enabled
 * - MSB of the data is transmitted first
 * - Transfer mode 0
 * - SPI MUX Setting E
 *   - MOSI on pad 2, extension header 2, pin 16
 *   - MISO on pad 0, extension header 2, pin 17
 *   - SCK on pad 3, extension header 2, pin 18
 *   - SS on extension header 2, pin 15
 * - 8-bit character size
 * - Not enabled in sleep mode
 * - Baudrate 100000
 * - GLCK generator 0
 *
 * The SPI slave will be configured with the following settings:
 * - Slave mode enabled
 * - Preloading of shift register enabled
 * - MSB of the data is transmitted first
 * - Transfer mode 0
 * - SPI MUX Setting E
 *   - MISO on pad 2, extension header 1, pin 16
 *   - MOSI on pad 0, extension header 1, pin 17
 *   - SCK on pad 3, extension header 1, pin 18
 *   - SS on pad 1, extension header 1, pin 15
 * - 8-bit character size
 * - Not enabled in sleep mode
 * - GLCK generator 0
 *
 * Note that the pinouts on other boards may different, see next sector for
 * details.
