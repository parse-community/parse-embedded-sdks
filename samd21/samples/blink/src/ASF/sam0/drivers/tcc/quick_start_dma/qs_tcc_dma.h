/**
 * \page asfdoc_sam0_tcc_dma_use_case Quick Start Guide for Using DMA with TCC
 *
 * The supported board list:
 *    - SAM D21/R21 Xplained Pro
 *
 * In this use case, the TCC will be used to generate a PWM signal. Here
 * the pulse width varies through following values with the help of DMA
 * transfer: one quarter of the period, half of the period and three quarters
 * of the period.
 * The PWM output can be used to drive an LED. The waveform can also be
 * viewed using an oscilloscope.
 * The output signal is also fed back to another TCC channel by event system,
 * the event stamps are captured and transferred to a buffer by DMA.
 *
 * The PWM output is set up as follows:
 * <table>
 *  <tr><th> Board        </td><th> Pin  </td><th> Connect to </td></tr>
 *  <tr><td> SAMD21 Xpro  </td><td> PB30 </td><td> LED0       </td></tr>
 *  <tr><td> SAMR21 Xpro  </td><td> PA19 </td><td> LED0       </td></tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * The TCC module will be setup as follows:
 * - GCLK generator 0 (GCLK main) clock source
 * - Use double buffering write when set top, compare or pattern through API
 * - No dithering on the counter or compare
 * - No prescaler
 * - Single Slope PWM wave generation
 * - GCLK reload action
 * - Don't run in standby
 * - No fault or waveform extensions
 * - No inversion of waveform output
 * - No capture enabled
 * - Count upward
 * - Don't perform one-shot operations
 * - Counter starts on 0
 * - Counter top set to 0x1000
 * - Channel 0 (on SAM D21 Xpro) or 3 (on SAM R21 Xpro) is set to
 *   compare and match value 0x1000*3/4 and generate event
 * - Channel 1 is set to capture on input event
 *
 * The event resource of EVSYS module will be setup as follows:
 * - TCC match capture channel 0 (on SAM D21 Xpro) or 3 (on SAM R21 Xpro) is
 *   selected as event generator
 * - Event generation is synchronous, with rising edge detected
 * - TCC match capture channel 1 is the event user
 *
 * The DMA resource of DMAC module will be setup as follows:
 * - Two DMA resources are used
 * - Both DMA resources use peripheral trigger
 * - Both DMA resources perform beat transfer on trigger
 * - Both DMA resources use beat size of 16-bits
 * - Both DMA resources are configured to transfer 3 beats and
 *   then repeat again in same buffer
 * - On DMA resource which controls the compare value
 *   - TCC0 overflow triggers DMA transfer
 *   - The source address increment is enabled
 *   - The destination address is fixed to TCC channel 0 Compare/Capture
 *register
 * - On DMA resource which reads the captured value
 *   - TCC0 capture on channel 1 triggers DMA transfer
 *   - The source address is fixed to TCC channel 1 Compare/Capture register
 *   - The destination address increment is enabled
 *   - The captured value is transferred to an array in SRAM
