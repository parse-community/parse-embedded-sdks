 *
 * The following devices can use this module:
 *  - SAM D20/D21
 *  - SAM R21
 *  - SAM D10/D11
 *
 * The outline of this documentation is as follows:
 *  - \ref asfdoc_sam0_nvm_prerequisites
 *  - \ref asfdoc_sam0_nvm_module_overview
 *  - \ref asfdoc_sam0_nvm_special_considerations

 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam0_nvm_prerequisites Prerequisites
 *
 * There are no prerequisites for this module.
 *
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam0_nvm_module_overview Module Overview
 *
 * The Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) module provides an interface to the device's
 * Non-Volatile Memory controller, so that memory pages can be written, read,
 * erased and reconfigured in a standardized manner.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_nvm_module_overview_regions Memory Regions
 * The NVM memory space of the SAM devices is divided into two sections:
 * a Main Array section, and an Auxiliary space section. The Main Array space
 * can be configured to have an (emulated) EEPROM and/or boot loader section.
 * The memory layout with the EEPROM and bootloader partitions is shown in
 * \ref asfdoc_sam0_nvm_module_mem_layout "the figure below".
 *
 * \anchor asfdoc_sam0_nvm_module_mem_layout
 * \dot
 * digraph memory_layout {
 *  size="5,5"
 *  node [shape=plaintext]
 *  memory [label=<
 *   <table border="0" cellborder="1" cellspacing="0" >

 *     <td align="right" border="0"> End of NVM Memory </td>
 *     <td rowspan="3" align="center"> Reserved EEPROM Section </td>

 *    <tr>
 *     <td align="right" border="0"> Start of NVM Memory</td>
 *    </tr>
 *   </table>
 *  >]
 * }
 * \enddot
 *
 * The Main Array is divided into rows and pages, where each row contains four
 * pages. The size of each page may vary from 8-1024 bytes dependent of the
 * device. Device specific parameters such as the page size and total number of
 * pages in the NVM memory space are available via the \ref nvm_get_parameters()
 * function.
 *
 * A NVM page number and address can be computed via the following equations:
 *
 * \f[ PageNum = (RowNum \times 4) + PagePosInRow \f]
 * \f[ PageAddr = PageNum \times PageSize \f]
 *
 * \ref asfdoc_sam0_nvm_module_row_layout "The figure below" shows an example
 * of the memory page and address values associated with logical row 7 of the
 * NVM memory space.
 *
 * \anchor asfdoc_sam0_nvm_module_row_layout
 * \dot
 * digraph row_layout {
 *  size="4,4"
 *  node [shape=plaintext]
 *  row [label=<
 *   <table border="0" cellborder="1" cellspacing="0">
 *    <tr>
 *     <td align="right" border ="0"> Row 0x07 </td>
 *     <td > Page 0x1F </td>
 *     <td > Page 0x1E </td>
 *     <td > Page 0x1D </td>
 *     <td > Page 0x1C </td>

 *     <td border="0"> 0x700 </td>
 *    </tr>
 *   </table>
 *  >]
 * }
 * \enddot
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_nvm_module_overview_locking_regions Region Lock Bits
 * As mentioned in \ref asfdoc_sam0_nvm_module_overview_regions, the main
 * block of the NVM memory is divided into a number of individually addressable
 * pages. These pages are grouped into 16 equal sized regions, where each region
 * can be locked separately issuing an \ref NVM_COMMAND_LOCK_REGION command or
 * by writing the LOCK bits in the User Row. Rows reserved for the EEPROM
 * section are not affected by the lock bits or commands.
 *
 * \note By using the \ref NVM_COMMAND_LOCK_REGION or
 *       \ref NVM_COMMAND_UNLOCK_REGION commands the settings will remain in
 *       effect until the next device reset. By changing the default lock
 *       setting for the regions, the auxiliary space must to be written,
 *       however the adjusted configuration will not take effect until the next
 *       device reset.
 *
 * \note If the \ref asfdoc_sam0_nvm_special_consideration_security_bit is
 *       set, the auxiliary space cannot be written to. Clearing of the security
 *       bit can only be performed by a full chip erase.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_nvm_module_overview_sub_rw Read/Write
 * Reading from the NVM memory can be performed using direct addressing into the
 * NVM memory space, or by calling the \ref nvm_read_buffer() function.
 *
 * Writing to the NVM memory must be performed by the \ref nvm_write_buffer()
 * function - additionally, a manual page program command must be issued if
 * the NVM controller is configured in manual page writing mode, or a buffer of
 * data less than a full page is passed to the buffer write function.
 *
 * Before a page can be updated, the associated NVM memory row must be erased
 * first via the \ref nvm_erase_row() function. Writing to a non-erased page
 * will result in corrupt data being stored in the NVM memory space.
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam0_nvm_special_considerations Special Considerations
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_nvm_special_consideration_pageerase Page Erasure
 * The granularity of an erase is per row, while the granularity of a write is
 * per page. Thus, if the user application is modifying only one page of a row,
 * the remaining pages in the row must be buffered and the row erased, as an
 * erase is mandatory before writing to a page.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_nvm_special_consideration_clocks Clocks
 * The user must ensure that the driver is configured with a proper number of
 * wait states when the CPU is running at high frequencies.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_nvm_special_consideration_security_bit Security Bit
 * The User Row in the Auxiliary Space Cannot be read or written when
 * the Security Bit is set. The Security Bit can be set by using passing
 * \ref NVM_COMMAND_SET_SECURITY_BIT to the \ref nvm_execute_command() function,
 * or it will be set if one tries to access a locked region. See
 * \ref asfdoc_sam0_nvm_module_overview_locking_regions.
 *
 * The Security Bit can only be cleared by performing a chip erase.
 *
