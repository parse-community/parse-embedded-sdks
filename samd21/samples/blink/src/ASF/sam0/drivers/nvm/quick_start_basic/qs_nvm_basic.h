/**
 * \page asfdoc_sam0_nvm_basic_use_case Quick Start Guide for NVM - Basic
 *
 * In this use case, the NVM module is configured for:
 *  \li Power reduction mode enabled after sleep until first NVM access
 *  \li Automatic page write commands issued to commit data as pages are written
 *      to the internal buffer
 *  \li Zero wait states when reading FLASH memory
 *  \li No memory space for the EEPROM
 *  \li No protected bootloader section
 *
 * This use case sets up the NVM controller to write a page of data to flash,
 * and the read it back into the same buffer.
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam0_nvm_basic_use_case_setup Setup
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_nvm_basic_use_case_setup_prereq Prerequisites
 * There are no special setup requirements for this use-case.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_nvm_basic_use_case_setup_code Code
 * Copy-paste the following setup code to your user application:
 * \snippet qs_nvm_basic.c setup
 *
 * Add to user application initialization (typically the start of \c main()):
 * \snippet qs_nvm_basic.c setup_init
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_nvm_basic_use_case_setup_flow Workflow
 * -# Create an NVM module configuration struct, which can be filled
 *    out to adjust the configuration of the NVM controller.
 *    \snippet qs_nvm_basic.c setup_1
 * -# Initialize the NVM configuration struct with the module's default
 *    values.
 *    \snippet qs_nvm_basic.c setup_2
 *    \note This should always be performed before using the configuration
 *          struct to ensure that all values are initialized to known default
 *          settings.
 *
 * -# Configure NVM controller with the created configuration struct settings.
 *    \snippet qs_nvm_basic.c setup_3
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam0_nvm_basic_use_case_main Use Case
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_nvm_basic_use_case_main_code Code
 * Copy-paste the following code to your user application:
 * \snippet qs_nvm_basic.c main
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_nvm_basic_use_case_main_flow Workflow
 * -# Set up a buffer one NVM page in size to hold data to read or write into
 *    NVM memory.
 *    \snippet qs_nvm_basic.c main_1
 * -# Fill the buffer with a pattern of data.
 *    \snippet qs_nvm_basic.c main_2
 * -# Create a variable to hold the error status from the called NVM functions.
 *    \snippet qs_nvm_basic.c main_3
 * -# Erase a page of NVM data. As the NVM could be busy initializing or
 *    completing a previous operation, a loop is used to retry the command while
 *    the NVM controller is busy.
 *    \snippet qs_nvm_basic.c main_4
 *    \note This must be performed before writing new data into a NVM page.
 *
 * -# Write the buffer of data to the previously erased page of the NVM.
 *    \snippet qs_nvm_basic.c main_5
 *    \note The new data will be written to NVM memory automatically, as the
 *          NVM controller is configured in automatic page write mode.
 *
 * -# Read back the written page of page from the NVM into the buffer.
 *    \snippet qs_nvm_basic.c main_6
